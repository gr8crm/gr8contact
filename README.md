# GR8 Contact

This is a demo application based on the Grails Web Application Framework.
It was first presented at GR8Conf Europe 2014 by GÃ¶ran Ehrsson @goeh.

The application is a simple Contact Management application where you can manage your companies and contacts.

The repository has three branches: master, m1 and m2 that represents snapshots in time when developing the application.

**master**: A plain Grails application, created with *grails create-app*

**m1**: The plugin *crm-contact-lite* was installed and contact CRUD features are available.

**m2**: The plugin *crm-content-ui* was installed and documents can now be attached to contacts.
